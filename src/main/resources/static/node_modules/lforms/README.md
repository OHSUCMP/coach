## What is LForms?

[LForms](http://lhncbc.github.io/lforms/), a.k.a. LHC-Forms, is a feature-rich,
open-source widget that creates input forms, based on definition files, for
Web-based applications.  In addition to its native form-definition format, it
partially supports the HL7 FHIR Questionnaire standard (SDC profile), and work
is in progress to expand that support.

It is being developed by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical
Communications ([LHNCBC](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov)), National Library of
Medicine ([NLM](https://www.nlm.nih.gov)), part of the National Institutes of
Health ([NIH](https://www.nih.gov)), with the collaboration and support from the
[Regenstrief Institute](https://www.regenstrief.org/), Inc. and the
[LOINC](https://loinc.org/) Committee.
